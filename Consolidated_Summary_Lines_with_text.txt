The video shows cops approaching the elderly woman and asking her to leave. Minutes later, cops can be seen attacking the frail woman from a seat in an area reserved for train passengers who have purchased tickets. When a woman repeatedly told the authoritarian agents that she can`t stand without the assistance of her cane, they ignored her and locked handcuffs around her wrists. Then one of the cops proceeded to shove her head down in order to force cooperation and smashed it into the wooden chair. Then the woman can be heard screaming in pain.

According to Jack Daniels` maker, Nearis Green, an enslaved man was behind the world-famous recipe of America`s most popular whisky. Green was the one who taught Jasper Newton Jack Daniel how to run his Tennessee distillery. Until now, the story was told that a white moonshine distiller named Dan Call had taught Jasper Jack Daniel how to run his Tennessee distillery. But it appears one of the Dan Call`s slaves passed on his experience to Daniel. Thus, we must admit that enslaved people played a crucial role in the whiskey-making process in the same way that white cooks often appropriated recipes from their enslaved black cooks. Back in 1800s whites used to take credits for the people who really did work.

Two criminals with no reasons committed this cruel attack. It is an unhealthy society if those who serve for the nationâ€™s security become victims. In the beginning of February seven law enforcement officers were killed in seven days period! And what did our Commander-in-Chief do? He did no actions and he didnâ€™t even appeal to the nation. Seven policemen were attacked and Obama didnâ€™t leave a single comment on that. A total indifference of the highest ranks only whips up the criminal elements to attack the police and this series of attacks will not end until something is done about that. We live in times when even those who protect us need our own support and protection. The heroes must never be forgotten.

The term illegal alien or illegal immigrant had been used to describe those who came to the US without permission and proceeded to establish residence without authorization. Since around 2000, however, many news sources at the behest of immigrant activists changed their terminology to undocumented immigrant instead. Not only is the new term less accurate than the old one, but it also confuses the reader because the word undocumented can have a two meanings. It can refer to those who never had proper documentation and those who don't have the required documentation on their person right at that moment. It is kind of like when you are stopped for driving without a license. You may have it at home, just not with you in the car.

For example just recently U.S. Border Patrol agents seized a cache of high-powered firearms that were in the possession of people involved in ongoing smuggling operations during a raid in Oxnard, California. Border Patrol agents were investigating a Ford F-150 pickup truck that they suspected was involved in cross-border smuggling operations on September 7, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials. The Ford truck was tied back to the address of the Oxnard residence.

For instance, recently, after crossing the crosswalk on Rogero Road, 21-year-old Devonte Shipman was approached by Florida deputies. Jacksonville Sheriffâ€™s Deputy J.

Secondly, the young man crossed the road while the signal displayed a â€œred hand.â€ Finally, he didnâ€™t have his ID on him while being questioned. Thus, he must pay a $65 fine. When Shipman asked officers for a warning of a citation, Bolen detained him and threatened with arrest.

True facts and events are erased from history books, and names of our heroes are deleted from American maps. We want and we must keep the truth for further generations of Americans. This week weâ€™ll publish some posts about true motivations of the Civil War and some of the myths that replaced the truth. The Civil War was a great time of glorious battles. The whole nation was divided and separated by fratricidal war, and the North was victorious in that conflict.

Apparently, the police didnâ€™t know who started the fight, and instead of finding out, they decided to clear the whole restaurant. Luckily, the video captured the entire incident. In the video, Vanae is sitting by herself in an empty corner of the restaurant with BCSO Deputy Cynthia Hernandez standing next to her.
